# Project 1 - Get-Fit
Get-Fit is an application that will randomize your daily or weekly work-outs to focus on strength, cardio, functional fitness and core training.

# User Story:
As a user, I am presented with a randomized set of exercises that focuses on certain areas of body regions
when I select the two muscle groups of my choice. 

# Acceptance Criteria:
WHEN I click to populate random exercises
THEN I am given five appropriate exercises per muscle group. 
WHEN I click on the drop-down menu 
THEN I am given all muscle group options. 
WHEN I click on the day,
THEN it populates on the chosen day. 
WHEN we are on the current day, 
THEN that day is a different color that differentiates from the rest of week. 
WHEN I reopen the application
THEN I am able to see my previously generated workouts. 
WHEN I click on the Reset button, 
THEN the calendar resets. 
WHEN I re-click Exercise button, 
THEN I am given a new set of randomly chosen exercises.
