        <h3>CHEST</h3>
        <p>BARBELL BENCH PRESS: Position yourself with your back down on a flat bench placing the hands up on the bar using an underhand grip slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.
            After taking a deep breath in, extend the elbows and lift the bar up off the rack until elbows are extended but not locked. Pause for a brief movement as you fully extend your breath.
            Lower the weight directly down to the chest as you breath inwards, keeping the movement pattern slow and steady.
            Once just above the chest, pause, and then press directly up again, exhaling your breath.
            Continue until all reps are completed and then re-rack the barbell.</p>
        <p>DUMBBELL FLYES: Pick up dumbbells and hold them above you with a slight bend in the elbow.
            Keeping the dumbbells in line with your chest, slowly open up your arms to the sides.
            Stop when your upper arms are parallel with the floor.
            Squeeze your chest muscles and slowly return to starting position. Repeat.</p>
        <p>PUSH UPS: Get into position by placing your hands flat on the floor, directly below your shoulders.
            Extend your legs out behind you, with only your toes and balls of your feet touching the floor.
            Hold your body up and keep your back straight by tightening your abdominal muscles.
            Your neck and head should be bent slightly back.
            Lower your chest towards the ground by bending your elbows until your chest is just above the ground or you feel a stretching of your chest and shoulders. Hold for a count of one.
            Press upwards from your chest and shoulders, straightening your arms as you return to the starting position. Hold for a count of one.
            Repeat.</p>
        <p>DECLINE PUSH UPS: Facing down, place yourself on the ground with your hands flat on the floor, directly below your shoulders.
            Place your feet on top of a bench or box. Only your toes and balls of your feet should be touching the floor.
            Maintain a flat back and tight core before lowering your chest towards the ground. Bend your elbows at a 60-degree angle until your chest is just above the ground. You should feel a stretch across your chest. Hold for a count of one.
            Push yourself back to the starting position by straightening your arms. Do not lock out your elbows.
            Repeat.</p>
        <p>INCLINE PUSH UPS: Set up a bench or stable elevated surface. Begin with both hands on the bench at shoulder-width or just outside of shoulder-width.
            Place your feet straight behind you while you tighten your abs and engage the hips. Your hips should not dip or elevate too high during the movement.
            Slowly lower yourself towards the bench. Once your upper arms are parallel with the floor, pause, and return to the starting position.</p>
        <p>INCLINE BARBELL BENCH PRESS: Set up an incline bench in front of a weight rack, making sure you adjust the incline to a comfortable position. The back of the bench should be facing the weight stack.
            Sit on the bench placing your back firmly against the backrest.
            Using an overhand grip, grasp the bar with your hands spaced about twice your shoulder-width apart.
            Lift the bar from the rack by pushing up with your chest muscles and hold it straight over your chest with your arms fully extended. This is the start position.
            As you inhale, lower the barbell slowly until it touches your upper chest.
            Hold for a count of one while squeezing your chest muscles.
            Return to the start position as you exhale, pushing the bar using your chest muscles. Hold for a count of one.
            Repeat.</p>
        <p>DECLINE BARBELL BENCH PRESS: Set a barbell in a weight rack at the low end of a decline bench,making sure it is at a height you can reach without fully extending your arms.
            Secure your feet under the stirrup, bar or strap at the high end of the bench and lie flat on your back with the rack slightly behind you.
            Using an overhand grip, grip the bar with your hands about twice your shoulder-width apart.
            Push up to lift the bar from the rack and hold it directly over you with your arms locked. Your arms should be at 90 degrees to the floor. This is the start position.
            Bend your elbows to slowly lower the barbell until it touches our chest, inhaling as you do so.
            Hold for a count of one.
            Return to the start position by pushing the bar using your chest muscles, exhaling as you do so.

        <p>FARMER'S CARRY: Place a pair of dumbbells or kettlebells at your feet. Brace your core and keep your chest up as you kneel down. Pick the dumbbells up, maintaining your form and keeping your gaze straight ahead.
            Standing up, walk forward in a straight line, holding the dumbbells at your sides.
            The trick is to use very heavy dumbbells. Walk as far as you can then set the weights down. Take a short break and repeat going back the other way.</p>
        <p>TRICEPS DIPS: Standing between the bars of a dip station, grip the bars with an overhand grip,keeping your elbows tucked in close to your body.

            Repeat.</p>
        <p>DUMBBELL BENCH PRESS: Lie on a flat bench holding a dumbbell in each hand with an overhand grip.

            Push the weights up by straightening your arms.
            As you push the weights up, move your arms in an arc to bring the dumbbells together, until they meet over the center of your chest. Hold for a count of one.
            Lower the dumbbells by slowly bending your elbows back to 90 degrees.
            Continue lowering your arms until they are a little lower than parallel to the floor. (Your elbows should be pointing slightly towards the floor and you should feel a stretch in your chest muscles and shoulders.)
            Repeat.</p>
        <p>DECLINE DUMBBELL PRESS: Sit on a decline bench and place your feet under the leg brace. Rest a dumbbell on each thigh.
            Grab hold of the dumbbells with an overhand grip and lie back on the bench.
            Position the dumbbells on either side of your chest. Your palms should face outwards and your arms should be bent under each weight.
            Slowly press the dumbbells up from the elbows until your arms are fully extended over your chest.

            Continue raising the dumbbells until your arms are straight and the dumbbells are suspended above your chest. Hold for a count of one.
            Lower the dumbbells back towards your chest by relaxing your chest and shoulders while bending your elbows.
            Hold for a count of one
            Repeat.</p>
        <p>CABLE CROSSOVER: Stand between two cable stations with the dumbbell grip handles attached to the high pulleys on each side of you.
            Hold the handles with an overhand grip. Your arms should be outstretched.
            Bend your knees and hips slightly so that you are leaning forward, but not too far.
            Bend your elbows slightly and rotate your shoulders in towards the centre of your chest a little. Your elbows should be slightly behind you.
            Use a hugging motion, keeping your elbows in a fixed, bent position to bring the grip attachments together in front of your chest.

            Repeat.</p>

            Pause to feel the contraction in your chest then slowly lower the handles to the starting position.
            </p>
        <p>LANDMINE PRESS: Using a T-Bar, load the amount of weight you’d like to work with (start out lighter to master the form before increasing the load).
            Grip the top of the barbell so that your hands overlap, and your palms are facing inward.
            Squat so that your knees are at a 90 degree bend with the top of the barbell almost resting on your chest. Make sure your elbows are low and close to your body and not flaring out.

            Starting with either leg, flex your knee and hip at the same time to bring your knee up and under your hip. 
            Your other leg should remain fully extended. This is the start position.
            Using an explosive movement, reverse the position of your legs, by extending the bent leg back and 
            simultaneously flexing the straight leg until it is in the startposition.
            Continue alternating in this manner for the desire amount of time.</p>
        <p>BIRD DOG: Position yourself on all fours with knees underneath the hips and wrists under the shoulders.

            and lower them back down to shoulder-height. Repeat. </p>
        <p>HIGH PULL: Prepare a barbell with a lighter amount of weight than usual. Place the barbell in front of you at your shins.
            Squat down into position, driving your hips back. Keep your chest and head up. Place your hands in an overhand grip on the barbell. Your arms should be straight with a slight bend at the elbow.
            In one fluid motion, explode up and off the ground as you pull the bar high, leading with your elbows. Your feet will leave the ground.
            Land softly and lower yourself back to the starting position.</p>
        <p>SEATED DUMBBELL CLEAN: Hold a dumbbell in each hand and sit on the edge of a bench. Keep your lower back flat, lean Forward. 
            Explosively straighten your body and shrug the weights so your arms rise.

            Rise up with the bar. Completely extend your hips and body. In upright position, lock your hips. 
            For the high pull, focus on exploding upwards with the lower body and hips to create upward momentum. 
            Then pull the barbell violently toward your neck – anywhere between the nipple line and neck constitutes a high pull. 
            Keep the bar close and the elbows high.</p>

            until your back arches upwards and you are looking between your feet. (Your body should form an upside down “V” shape) This is the start position.
            As you slowly exhale, bend your elbows, so that your chest and body arc forward and your hips move towards the floor.
            As you reach the start position, continue the movement by arching your back and straightening your arms. 
            This will push your torso upwards so that your head and chest raise and you are looking above you.
            Slowly inhale and push through your arms to return to the start position. Repeat.</p>
        <p>PIKE PRESS: Get into a push-up position, resting the tips of your feet on a swiss ball. Keep your legs straight behind you.

            Keeping your back straight and using only your arms, extend through your shoulders and elbows to drive the dumbbells straight up, ehaling as you do so.
            As your arms reach the fully extended position, bring them in towards each other until the dumbbels touch lightly together.
            Hold for a count of one, while squeezing your shoulder muscles.
            In a controlled movement, return to the starting position, inhaling as you do so.
            Repeat. </p>
        <p>SNATCH-GRIP LOW PULL: The snatch low-pull is identical to the snatch pull with the exception of a continued upward pull of the bar with the arms 
            following the extension of the body, but with a lower angle than the high pull. With your feet about hip width apart, step up to a barbell (on the ground) a place the feet slightly outwards.

        <p>UPRIGHT ROW: Stand with your back straight, holding a barbell with an overhand grip slightly less than shoulder width apart.
            The bar should be level with the tops of your thighs.
            Keep your arms extended with a slight bend at the elbows. This is the start position.
            Exhale and using the sides of your shoulders lift the bar.
            As you do so, raise your elbows up and out to the side.
            Keep the bar close to your body as you raise it.
            Continue  lifting the bar until it is just below your chin. Pause for a count of one.
